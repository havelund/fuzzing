rule p: always c1?(time=t1?) => wnext c2?(time=t2?) => t1 < t2

We need a way to compare time points independent of what the
commands are.

--- Communication ---
[x] send - Transmit data or messages back to the ground station.
[ ] receive - Listen for and process incoming commands or data.
[ ] ping - Send a status request to verify communication.
[ ] acknowledge - Confirm receipt of a command.
[ ] relay - Forward data to another spacecraft or station.

--- Science and Observation ---
[x] capture - Take a photo or collect sensor data.
[ ] analyze - Process collected samples or data.
[ ] scan - Perform a surface or area scan using sensors.
[ ] sample - Collect physical samples from the environment.
[ ] deploy - Release instruments like rovers or satellites.

--- Operational Control ---
[ ] power_on - Turn on a specific system or instrument.
[ ] power_off - Turn off a specific system or instrument.
