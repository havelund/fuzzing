[x] capture - Take a photo or collect sensor data.
[ ] analyze - Process collected samples or data.
[ ] scan - Perform a surface or area scan using sensors.
[ ] sample - Collect physical samples from the environment.
[ ] deploy - Release instruments like rovers or satellites.

--- Operational Control ---
[ ] power_on - Turn on a specific system or instrument.
